= Words in Swedenborg - Digital Edition

This project makes the glossary from link:https://newchurchbooks.com/product/words-in-swedenborg/[Words in Swedenborg and Their Meanings in Modern English] available in a machine-readable format. This serves two purposes: enabling export of the glossary to various formats, and providing a semantic resource for AI systems to interpret certain English words used in non-standard ways in translations of Swedenborg's Latin.

The project also includes code and support files to generate an AsciiDoc version of the book, essentially a digital reproduction of the original paperback. This can then be converted to PDF, ePub, and other formats.

Thanks to the General Church Publication Committee for making this digital copy available for free (see the LICENSE file for details). Thanks also to the maintainer of https://www.swedenborgstudy.com/[swedenborgstudy.com] for providing the glossary in HTML format for conversion to JSON, and for providing image files for the diagrams in the book.

== Project Structure

* `src/` - Source code for conversion scripts
* `book/` - Book content (AsciiDoc source and images from the original book)
* `test/` - Test files and sample data
* `swedenborg-glossary.json` - The glossary data in JSON format
* `swedenborg-glossary.schema.json` - JSON schema for validating glossary data

== Usage

A Makefile is provided that tracks dependencies so that changing source files automatically triggers rebuilding of dependent targets.

[source,bash]
----
make                   # Build glossary AsciiDoc and run tests
make pdf               # Generate PDF book
make test              # Run all tests
make clean             # Remove generated files
make help              # Display all targets and dependencies
----

== Dependencies

* Make
* Python 3.9+
* jsonschema (for validation)
* asciidoctor-pdf (for PDF generation)

Install Python dependencies with:

[source,bash]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt

== The Glossary JSON File

The `swedenborg-glossary.json` file is designed to be LLM-friendly:

* **Structured data** - Each entry has clearly separated fields for word, origin, part of speech, definitions, and more
* **Slugified keys** - Consistent, normalized identifiers (e.g., `a-posteriori-reasoning`) enable fast lookup
* **Semantic relationships** - Fields like `parent`, `see_also`, and `opposite_slug` capture connections between related terms
* **Context for archaic usage** - The `archaic_usage` field explains when a word is used in an older sense that differs from modern English
* **Theological context** - The `theological_term` field explains when Swedenborg gives a word a specific doctrinal meaning
* **Lightweight formatting** - Simple markers (`|word|` for keyword references, `_text_` for italics) are easy to parse or strip
* **Self-documenting schema** - The companion `swedenborg-glossary.schema.json` provides full documentation of all fields

This makes the glossary suitable for use in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems or as context for AI assistants working with Swedenborg translations.
